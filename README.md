# ☕ Java Scenario-Based Interview Questions

Welcome to **Java-Scenario-Based-Interview-Questions** 🚀  
This repository is a curated collection of **real-world, scenario-based Java interview questions** designed to help developers **think like engineers**, not just memorize answers.

The focus here is on **understanding, reasoning, and discussion**, which is exactly what interviewers look for in mid-to-senior Java roles.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- To cover **practical Java interview scenarios**
- To explain **why and how** things work, not just *what*

## ✍️ Question Format

Each scenario generally follows this structure:

1. **Problem Scenario**
2. **What is happening internally**
3. **Why this issue occurs**
4. **Possible solutions**
5. **Best practices**
6. **Interview-focused explanation**

This format ensures clarity and depth.
